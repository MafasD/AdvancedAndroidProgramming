1. Object = Collection of data.

2. Class = Kind of a function, always started with the class word.

3. Instantiation of object (creating an object) = In order to create an object you need to use the variable declaration "new".
for example: car toyota = new car(); , in this case car is a class and toyota is an object.

4. Visibility (public / private / protected) = Public can be accessed anywhere, protected by classes of the same package and 
subclasses of the same and different packages, private can only be accessed by the same class.

5. Member datas / methods = Method means code which only works when it is called.

6. Inheritance = When you use inheritance on an object, the object gets all properties and behaviours from the inherited object.

7. Interface = specifies what class must do but not how(the method) can have variables and methods but methods are abstract(class without objects).

8. Polymorphism = With polymorphism you can perform a single action in multiple different ways.

9. Overriding = Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that 
is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

10.Abstract classes = Basically classes without objects.
